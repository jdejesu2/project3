        <p>
          My name is Jessica DeJesus. I was born and raised in Chicago IL on the Northwest side also known
          as the Belmont Cragin area. I attended Prosser Career Academy for my
          highschool career. Some of my interest are puppies, chips, and the
          color black. Well, that's all I got for now.

        <h2>Favorite Book Passage</h2>
        <p>
          “It's much easier to not know things sometimes. Things change and
          friends leave. And life doesn't stop for anybody. I wanted to laugh.
          Or maybe get mad. Or maybe shrug at how strange everybody was,
          especially me. I think the idea is that every person has to live for
          his or her own life and than make the choice to share it with other
          people. You can't just sit their and put everybody's lives ahead of
          yours and think that counts as love. You just can't. You have to do
          things. I'm going to do what I want to do. I'm going to be who I really
          am. And I'm going to figure out what that is. And we could all sit
          around and wonder and feel bad about each other and blame a lot of
          people for what they did or didn't do or what they didn't know.
          I don't know. I guess there could always be someone to blame.
          It's just different. Maybe it's good to put things in perspective,
          but sometimes, I think that the only perspective is to really be there.
          Because it's okay to feel things. I was really there. And that was
          enough to make me feel infinite. I feel infinite.”
          ― Stephen Chbosky, The Perks of Being a Wallflower
